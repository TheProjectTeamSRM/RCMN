Monitoring and maintenance of roads are still a pain-point for Governments and the Public Works Department. AutoSense is an end-to-end integrated solution for monitoring the condition of roads and bringing critical failures to the notice of the responsible personnel. The system automatically raises tickets for unkempt roads passes the raised ticket to higher authorities to ensure that the condition is maintained. This is particularly useful to monitor roads that are paved on tendered contracts by private contractors. Furthermore, such a system ensures regular upkeep and helps prevent accidents caused by unsafe road conditions. It is also a justified investment as the system merely adds functionality to the infrastructure that is already in place, since we use the public transport system and the state owned vehicles to survey the roads.
